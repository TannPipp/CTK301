	<h2>What I've done</h2>
	
	<p>For my educational background, I went to Heartland Community College where I spent the first two years of my college education to get an Associates Degree in Arts. I'd say overall I enjoyed my time there, it was a great introduction to how college was going to be. While I was there I got into the "Phi Theta Kappa" honor society.</p>

    <p> During my time in high school I enjoyed being a part of the theater or anything to do with acting. I got the chance to be a part of a few plays and musicals, both being a blast to work on and helping me build a sense of courage and confidence that helped me later on. Speech was also a great way to get good at my public speaking, I was a part of the Olympia High School speech team for 3 years where I ended up making it to the state finals of the Dramatic Duet Acting event my senior year. Speaking of musicals, I was also a part of my high school choir and chamber choir.</p>

    <p>I've also enjoyed getting to act in more personal environments, like when I got to be a part of a friend's short film a few summers ago. it was a really fun experience getting to be there for the full experience of finding a location to film on and having great times behind the scenes together. Being able to be creative on screen has just been amazing and shown me what it is I love to do.</p>
